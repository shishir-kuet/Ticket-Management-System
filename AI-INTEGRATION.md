## üéØ How It Works

### Homepage Context
```
Visitor: "What can this system do?"
AI: "Resolve AI is a comprehensive ticket management platform that streamlines customer support. We offer smart ticket categorization, team collaboration tools, real-time analytics, and AI-powered assistance. You can create tickets, track their progress, and communicate directly with support agents. Would you like to see our features in action or get started with a free account?"
```

### Customer Context
```

```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Prompts
Edit `app/Services/AIService.php` to customize AI behavior:

```php
private function buildSystemPrompt(string $context): string
{
    // Customize AI personality and knowledge here
}
```

### Model Settings
Adjust in your `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4                # Better responses, higher cost
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=200            # Longer responses
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.3           # More focused responses
```

### Rate Limiting
Modify `app/Http/Middleware/ChatbotRateLimit.php`:

```php
$maxRequests = 50;     // Increase general limit
$maxAIRequests = 20;   // Increase AI limit
```

## üìä Monitoring & Admin Panel

### AI Status Dashboard
Visit `/admin/ai-status` to:
- Monitor AI service health
- View usage statistics

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AI Service is not available"**
- Check your OpenAI API key in `.env`
- Run `php artisan config:cache`

- Consider using OpenAI's batching API for bulk operations

## üîê Security

### Best Practices
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns
- Regularly rotate API keys

### Data Privacy
